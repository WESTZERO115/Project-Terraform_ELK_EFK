server.port: 5601

# Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.

# This setting cannot end in a slash.
#server.basePath: ""

# Specifies whether Kibana should rewrite requests that are prefixed with
# `server.basePath` or require that they are rewritten by your reverse proxy.
# This setting was effectively always `false` before Kibana 6.3 and will
# default to `true` starting in Kibana 7.0.
#server.rewriteBasePath: false

# `server.basePath` is configured this URL should end with the same basePath.
